    <h2>About Kendrick Lamar</h2>
      <p>Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper from Compton, California. Lamar embarked on his musical career as a teenager under the moniker K-Dot, when he released a mixtape which garnered local attention and led to his signing with Carson-based independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE).

The album included Lamar's debut single, "HiiiPoWeR".
